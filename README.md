# PHL-1

## Status

This document is an early draft to outline a challenge/opportunity that all the institutions and individual contributors of Philadelphia might contribute to and unite behind. Please create issues or open pull requests to open discussions or suggest improvements/alternatives.

Its current form it should evolve towards being a statement that is concrete enough to serve as a lightening rod for productive dialog, without being overly prescriptive to shut out relevant ideas not yet found. After that, through active tummeling, input will be collected from the community on specifically how we as a region might go about this and what impacts it could have. Finally, a minimal-viable-plan should be ratified by a critical mass of stakeholders and a sign-on campaign driven towards collecting the necessary resources and changes.

## The Challenge / Opportunity

- Philadelphia has a number of public high schools that have proven models for bringing together technology, community partners, and special programming to create more meaningful learning experiences for Philadelphia students
- These schools operate primarily on the same funding level provided per-student to all Philadelphia public schools, but must raise funding separately each year for the supplemental staffing and materials that make what they do uniquely possible
- With PSP funding drying up, their futures are uncertain despite proven success. A path to expanding on their success to reach all of Philadelphia's students is no where in sight
- Supplemental programs to give schools extra meaning for their students have the power to change the narrative around public education within the cultural gravity of our major cities and counterbalance the effective segregration of driving enrollment primarily by zip code.

## The Questions

- **How do you leverage modern tools and the resources of a city to transform public education in Philadelphia?**
- **How do we indefinitely sustain the successful models for supplementing our public schools we already have, and get on a course towards offering the same opportunity to _every_ one of Philadelphia's public high schools?**

## Proposed Constraints

Solutions should...

- be indefinitely funded for enrolled schools
- be able to enroll existing schools in time to sustain the success we've already proven
- be able to eventually enroll all of Philadelphia's public high schools
- give principals autonomy to seek out or develop their school's proposal for enrollment
- give schools capacity to build and sustain community partnerships, leveraging the city's cultural wealth
- give social investors and entrepreneurs reason to believe success will be sustainable when they prove a model, leveraging the city's entrepreurial wealth
- give student's access to the digital world, leveraging the world's information wealth
- allow schools to cluster together under nonprofit resource pools that amplify the funding provided by their enrollment

## Example Plan

Over 10 years, build a $200m regional endowement for sustained innovation in Philadelphia's public schools. As the fund grows, slots of $200k/year would open up for enrollment proposals by school principals to sustain programs with at least 1.5 years of history. Each proposal must include a way to leverage community partnerships (e.g. a full-time partnership coordinater position), direct access for students to digital knowledge (e.g. a netbook for every incoming student and insurance/maintenence), and programming that engages students' interests beyond core curriculum.
